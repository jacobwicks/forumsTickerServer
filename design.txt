a javascript app
given a forum id
it scrapes the forum for the latest post from the first non-stickied thread
every 15 seconds
it runs the text of the post across the screen
looks like an old stock ticker


const getThreadsFromForumId = (forumId: number) => {
//https://forums.somethingawful.com/forumdisplay.php?forumid=269

}

const isNotSticky = (thread) => {
//thread doesn't have sticky icon
//<td class="title title_sticky">
//</td>
}

const getFirstNotStickiedThread = () => {
const threads = await getThreadsFromForumId(forumId);
const firstNotStickyThread = threads.find(thread => isNotSticky(thread));
const { threadId } = firstNotStickyThread;
return threadId;
}

const getLatestPostFromThread = (threadId) => {

}

const getLatestPost = () => {
const thread = await getFirstNotStickiedThread();
const post = getLatestPostFromThread(thread);

}

export const threadLastPost = (threadId: number) =>
    `${baseUrl}/showthread.php?threadid=${threadId}&goto=lastpost`;


If the post is still scrolling when we get the next post, then cut it off
